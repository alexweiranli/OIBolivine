"variableFo_thermocalc": python codes for calculatons of primitive olivine forsterite (Fo) contents using liquid compositions yielded by THERMOCALC modelling of KLB1 lherzolite and KG1 pyroxenite and the liquid fractions of the two lithologies yielded by pyMelt (Matthews et al. 2022; DOI: 10.30909/vol.05.02.469475), and the inversion code using pyMultinest (Buchner et al. 2014, DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201322971).
